----------PROJECT FILES----------------
Check References.txt to see where I got assets
that were not part of the Epic Games Unreal Engine
marketplace, as well as where I learned and implemented
many mechanics.

--------ABOUT PROJECT------------------------
I managed to get multiplayer to work through both 
the steam online subsystem, as well as direct IP
input. Steam must be open and logged in to use
steam online subsystem. If the user wishes to connect
through direct IP, steam must be exited out completely
(not in task manager). Make sure port fowarding is set up
for port 7777.

This is a project that was assigned as a coding test
by Carbonated Games. I was originally instructed to 
make this in Lumberyard, and while I am still not 
discouraged, I did not want to waste anymore time 
and decided to use Unreal Engine 4. Since I decided to
use Unreal Engine 4 instead of Lumberyard, I wanted to
challenge myself a little more and get better at using this
engine. This is only my second use.

This game was **supposed** to be a 3rd person shooter version
of Tic Tac Toe. I wanted to implement guns and projectiles, along
with enemies that crowd the hallways, requiring the player to fight
through the hall to activate the piece at the end. I decided to go
with no turn taking, I want the players to race for three in a row,
while trying to block each other off. 


WHAT THE PLAYER CAN DO:
- Play tic-tac-toe
- Gain EXP from winning
- Level up from enough EXP



KNOWN BUGS:
- Elevators behave weird on client end. I chose to not resolve this issue
due to time.



Mistakes:
- I realized after making EVERY SINGLE variable that I should've used arrays
to be more efficient.

- I am aware that my way of making multiplayer combatible
is not the most effiencent way, as when I learned more and things
started to click, I began to realize how I could implement things better.

- I overscoped my game, causing me to have to scrap mechanics
and over simplify game.

- The project became quite a mess as I began to rush efforts more and more at the end.

Take aways:
- I know how to use Unreal Engine at an entry level, and am eager
to become better at using it.

- Scope better to prevent rushing.

Incomplete:
- Enemies
- Enemy health bars
- Guns
- Projectiles
- Steam Subsystem
- Combat Montage

------SCHEDULE FOR MAKING THIS GAME---------

Day 6: Made name plates, got game to reset properly, added more HUD items,
add menus, added animation controller for sprinting, implemented sprinting,
added kill plane.


-------LESSONS I LEARNED-------
Being this is my second time ever using
Unreal Engine, I felt a little better and
quicker than my first use. I also pushed myself
to learn more about the engine.
